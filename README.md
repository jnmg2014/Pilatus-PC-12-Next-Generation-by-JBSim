# Pilatus-PC-12-Next-Generation-by-JBSim
Hello, users of the X-Plane forum! Before I even start, I would like to address this question: “What aircraft are you making?”. We are making a Pilatus PC-12 Next Generation with the Apex avionics. My name is Ben, and I’m the head programmer in JBSim. I would like to introduce my fellow developers in our team! I and @AVGEEKTEAM are the “founders” of JBSim. AVGEEKTEAM (hereby referred to as Joaquin) is currently our head sound (fmod) and head texture developer! Obviously, we need more developers than that. We have an amazing flight model developer (@Phillip Strydom), who has made some pretty nice progress. Our 3D modelers are @Fokker (interior) and @Windows98 (exterior).  Our Progress         As of this post, the JBSim team has made pretty good progress, in my opinion. We have made a nice amount of progress on the flight model, thanks to Phillip. Joaquin is starting on the fmod sounds, and I am a little bit less than halfway done with the Apex PFD. To wrap this section up, our 3D modeler is starting the model of the aircraft. See the "showcase" section for screenshots!
